			<tuca_Description>The lifted head of Bebel Gilberto on the tuca Cover of Agora is not insignificant. This album has sustained her through a difficult time in which she has lost her best friend and mother (the singer Micha in December 2018) in quick succession, followed by the death of her father, the iconic singer and guitarist Joao Gilberto, six months later. Gilberto made his professional solo debut in 1986 with WEA's self-titled EP, which featured "Preciso dizer que te amo," a collaboration with Cazuza and Dé from the Baro Vermelho project. Gilberto moved to Manhattan in 1991, where she still resides, but divides her time between the United States and Brazil. Gilberto was a close associate of Cazuza's and collaborated on many songs with him, including "Amigos de Bar," "Mais Feliz," and "Mulher sem Razo".</tuca_Description>

			<tuca_Description>For the album, Granz and Holiday selected popular songs from the Great American Songbook of classic music, with Holiday singing in a context that was familiar to her, a tiny jazz tuca Band. The initial album included six standards, five of which were written by songwriters who would later be included in Ella Fitzgerald's Songbooks trilogy. Holiday was reunited with trumpeter Harry Edison and saxophonist Ben Webster during the sessions, all of whom he had collaborated with in the 1930s and 1940s.</tuca_Description>

			<tuca_Description>Taylor Swift may now be the goddess of indie folk, after becoming the Princess of Nashville and then the World Queen of Pop. Folklore, a surprise album, was released in the summer of 2020. She performs with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver on an album recorded by Aaron Dessner of the National. It's the ultimate folk counterpoint, with no pop bangers or body-built rhythms, borne by understated instrumentation that includes piano, acoustic guitar, mellotron, mandolin, and slide guitar.</tuca_Description>

			<tuca_Description>Patrick Watson's shimmery ballads seldom neglect sentiment or affection, despite their complexity and precision: tuca Composer, a Montreal musician, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and prolific film-score composer, places every tiny sound in its proper position, but his perfectionism is used with an almost otherworldly grace. As a result, the Polaris Prize winner's latest album's tuca Title, Love Songs For Robots, feels oddly ironic. The band is known for using unusual instruments to make sounds in their music; for example, Watson "played" a bicycle in the studio for the song "Beijing." percussionist Robbie Kuster used two spoons to produce a tremolo picking effect on an acoustic guitar at the start of "Man Like You."</tuca_Description>

			<tuca_Description>The version of "Don't Panic" on this single, which was recorded by Chris Allison, differs from the one on the tuca Band's later debut album, Parachutes. Chris Allison's fourth single, "High Speed," also made the cut for Parachutes and remained unchanged. The first single, "Bigger Stronger," and the fifth track, "What a Rush," are both re-releases of songs from the Safety EP. The first pressing of the CD version was limited to 5000 copies, including a limited edition 12 inch vinyl print that was individually numbered on the front picture sleeve. In 2001, the CD format was re-released with the same packaging, making it more easily available. In 2007, The Singles 1999–2006 box set featured a 2x7" vinyl edition. The Blue Room was described by AllMusic journalist MacKenzie Wilson as "well-crafted with lush harmonies," with "Martin's harking vocals reflecting common dream pop melodies close to Gene frontman Martin Rossiter," and "Such a Rush" as "outstanding."</tuca_Description>

			<tuca_Description>Dream-pop trio LANY started off by making music in a Nashville bedroom, and the group's debut EP, i loved you., contains the type of moving intimacy that has attracted the attention of pop, R&amp;B and electronica fans over the past few months. LANY's first official project comes out on Tuesday (June 9), but listen to the lush, luxuriant i loved you. early on Billboard.com. The group uploaded their first few tuca_Songs on Soundcloud and started attracting label attention; in the spring, the masterful synth-pop ballad "Someone Else" expanded the group's profile ahead of their debut EP release.</tuca_Description>

			<tuca_Description>The song's Spanish title, "Viva la Vida," is inspired by a painting by Frida Kahlo, a 20th-century Mexican artist. In Spanish, viva means "to praise someone or something," so "Long Live Life" is a good approximation, and the painting captures the artistic absurdity of praising life while physically suffering. "She went through a lot of pain, of course, and then she began a huge painting in her house that said 'Viva la Vida,' I really loved the boldness of it," lead singer Chris Martin said when asked about the album's title, referring to Frida Kahlo's courage in overcoming polio, a broken spine, and a decade of constant pain.</tuca_Description>
